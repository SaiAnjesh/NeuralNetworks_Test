# Simple-Neural-Networks-Project
My first neural network project to gain hands-on experience in Pytorch

Motive : 
    
    To model and solve a simple mathematical function
    
    f = a + 3 * b

Provided code in 2 formats - '_.ipynb_' & '_.py_', for your reference

This is a sample neural network notebook
